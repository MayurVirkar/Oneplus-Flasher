Hello Guys, I was flashing my Oneplus with Stock 44, and its annoying to run all commands all the time. So created a script to do it for me.

Just thought of sharing it.

Requirements:
1: fastboot in PATH 
2: bootloader to be unlocked. 
just run "fastboot oem unlock"

Instructions:
1: extract the zip
2: paste the script in the same directory
3: chmod +x flasher.sh 
4: ./flasher.sh


NOTE: 
16 GB = flasher_16.sh
64 GB = flasher_64.sh

Simple, Clean script.

Feel free to fork, share or do whatever you want. :)
